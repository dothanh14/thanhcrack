    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      CRACKFORFUN was created to make it easy for gamers to discover free and legal games
      across a variety of platforms. We believe that everyone should have access to
      enjoyable gaming experiences without resorting to piracy or questionable websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team curates games from trusted sources such as the Internet Archive,
      LibreGameWiki, SourceForge, and mainstream stores like Steam and GOG.com, all
      of which offer legitimate free or open‑source games【620434672983963†L90-L104】.

    <p>
      To keep our site online, we earn a small amount through display advertisements
      and monetized short links. Paid URL shorteners work by showing a quick ad
      before redirecting you to the final game page — you earn money per 1,000
      clicks【47299132284175†L170-L188】. Display ads pay based on impressions; the more visitors
      see the ads, the more revenue we generate【437432026497915†L193-L217】.
    </p>
    <p>
      We respect the rights of game developers and urge our visitors to support them.
      If you enjoy a game, consider donating to its creators or purchasing official
      paid versions when available. Thank you for supporting CRACKFORFUN!
